[Advent of Code 2015](http://adventofcode.com/2015/)

This has Clojure solutions from when I was re-writing pre-existing solutions in Clojure, and then (mostly) Javascript solutions written later, when I was anticipating the 2017 Advent of Code. Some problems were originally solved in 2015, but never committed to source control. So it goes.
