For me, Advent of Code is an opportunity to

- Experiment with new languages or techniques

- Have fun solving problems

- Write deliberately bad code

With regards to the last point: in Advent of Code, the goal is to solve the problem, not to write code. Any code produced is going to be thrown away after its purpose is served, never to be thought of again (with a few exceptions!). It can be liberating (and amusing) to write code that breaks many of the rules of good software development; there are definitely things in here that I am not proud of, but at the same time have a certain perverse amusement at having written.
