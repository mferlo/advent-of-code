Solutions for [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com)

For me, Advent of Code is an opportunity to

- Experiment with new languages or techniques

- Have fun solving problems

- Write deliberately bad code

With regards to the last point: in Advent of Code, the goal is to solve the problem, not to write code. Any code produced is going to be thrown away after its purpose is served, never to be thought of again (with a few exceptions!). It can be liberating (and amusing) to write code that breaks many of the rules of good software development; there are definitely things in here that I am not proud of, but at the same time have a certain perverse amusement at having written.

Note that this repo was created by merging together separate repos for each individual year, which necessitated a `git mv` of the files in question. This makes some of the old commit messages ambiguous ("Day 23", sure, but which year?) and requires a `git log --follow` to see the history of a specific file. Some years/days may not be immediately runnable as committed to this repo, because they depended on build files or other configuration that is not present.
